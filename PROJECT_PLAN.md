# System Game - Project Plan

## Project Overview

System is a multiplayer, real-time, long-term 4X strategy game where the universe persists and evolves continuously, even when players are offline. Players manage multiple star systems, colonize planets, extract resources, construct buildings and spaceships, and expand their empires across the galaxy.

### Core Game Mechanics

- **Real-time Simulation**: Game runs continuously in the background, processing construction, resource extraction, and other actions even when players are offline
- **Multiple Game Instances**: Each galaxy is a separate game that can run independently for days or weeks
- **Procedural Generation**: Galaxies are procedurally generated with connected star systems via wormholes
- **Resource Management**: Extract and manage resources (Iron, Copper, Fuel, Soil) across planet grids
- **Building & Construction**: Build miners, farms, and other structures on planet surfaces
- **Fleet Management**: Construct and command spaceships for exploration and combat
- **Agent-Based AI**: Extensible agent system for autonomous entity behaviors

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS 4, React 19
- **Backend**: C# .NET 9, Entity Framework Core
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Cache/Pub-Sub**: Redis
- **Real-time Communication**: SignalR
- **Deployment**: Railway (planned)

## Technical Architecture

### Data Model

```
User (ASP.NET Identity)
  â””â”€ PlayerGame (Junction)
       â””â”€ Game â”€â”€ Galaxy â”€â”€ StarSystem â”€â”€ Planet â”€â”€ GridSquare
