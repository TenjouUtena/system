## Features Delivered

### 1. Testing Strategy ✅

#### Unit Testing (Recommended)

**Backend Services**
```csharp
// Example test structure
[TestClass]
public class CombatServiceTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    public void CalculateDamage_ValidInputs_ReturnsPositiveDamage()
    {
        // Arrange
        var service = new CombatService(context, logger);
        
        // Act
        var damage = service.CalculateDamage(100, 50);
        
        // Assert
        Assert.IsTrue(damage > 0);
        Assert.IsTrue(damage <= 100);
    }
}
```

**Coverage Targets**:
- Services: 70%+
- Business logic: 80%+
- Controllers: 50%+

#### Integration Testing (Recommended)

**API Endpoint Tests**
```csharp
[TestClass]
public class GamesControllerTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    public async Task CreateGame_ValidRequest_ReturnsCreatedGame()
    {
        // Arrange
        var request = new CreateGameRequest { Name = "Test Game" };
        
        // Act
        var response = await client.PostAsJsonAsync("/api/games", request);
        
        // Assert
        Assert.AreEqual(HttpStatusCode.Created, response.StatusCode);
    }
}

### 3. Player Documentation ✅

#### Game Guide

**Getting Started**
1. Register an account
2. Create your first game
3. Choose galaxy size (Small: 10 systems, Medium: 20, Large: 30)
4. View your starting system on the galaxy map
5. Click your home planet to begin

**Core Mechanics**

**Resources**
- **Iron**: Building material, ship construction
- **Copper**: Electronics, advanced ships
- **Fuel**: Ship movement, energy
- **Soil**: Food production (future), organic materials

**Buildings**
- **Iron Miner**: Extracts iron from planet
- **Copper Miner**: Extracts copper
- **Fuel Miner**: Extracts fuel
- **Farm**: Produces food from soil

**Construction**:
- Requires available Builder
- Takes 5 minutes (default)
- Builders auto-release when done

**Spaceships**

**Ship Types**:
1. **Scout** (Fast, cheap, weak) - Exploration
2. **Colony** (Special) - Colonizes new planets
3. **Freighter** (Large cargo) - Resource transport
4. **Destroyer** (Combat) - Basic warship
5. **Cruiser** (Heavy combat) - Advanced warship
6. **Carrier** (Support) - Fleet command
7. **Capital** (Ultimate) - Flagship

**Ship Mechanics**:
- Built at Shipyards (located at Space Stations)
- Construction time varies by type (2-30 minutes)
- Can move within system or via wormholes
- Engage in automatic combat when near enemies

**Combat**

**How It Works**:
- Ships within 50 units automatically engage
- Turn-based resolution (every 5 seconds)
- Damage based on Attack vs Defense
- Ships can flee when damaged
- Battle ends when one side destroyed/fled

**Strategy Tips**:
- Scout ships explore safely
- Destroyers counter scouts
- Cruisers dominate mid-game
- Capital ships require team effort
- Flee is tactical, not cowardly!

**Agents (Automation)**

**Agent Types**:
- **Auto-Builder**: Automatically constructs buildings
- **Resource Ferry**: Transports resources between systems
- **Production Monitor**: Tracks resource production

**Using Agents**:
1. Navigate to Agents page
2. Click "Create Agent"
3. Choose behavior type
4. Configure parameters
5. Agent runs automatically in background

**NPCs (Pirates)**

**Behavior Types**:
- **Patrol**: Random movement, low threat
- **Ambush**: Waits near wormholes
- **Aggressive**: Hunts player ships actively
- **Passive**: Only defends if attacked

**Rewards**:
- Iron, Copper, Fuel loot
- Experience for surviving ships
- Strategic challenge

**Strategy & Tips**

**Early Game (0-30 min)**:
1. Build 3-5 Iron Miners on resource-rich squares
2. Add Copper and Fuel miners
3. Create 2-3 Scout ships for exploration
4. Locate wormholes to nearby systems

**Mid Game (30 min - 2 hours)**:
1. Send Colony ship to second system
2. Build Destroyers for defense
3. Establish production in multiple systems
4. Create Shipyard at each station
5. Begin fleet building

**Late Game (2+ hours)**:
1. Cruiser and Capital ship production
2. Multi-system resource optimization
3. Large-scale fleet battles
4. Strategic empire management

**Multiplayer Tips**:
- Alliances matter (same player ships don't fight)
- Scout enemy systems before attacking
- Defend wormhole chokepoints
- Resource economy wins wars
- Capital ships are end-game
