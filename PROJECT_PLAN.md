# System Game - Project Plan v2.0
## Replanned for Launchable Game

## Project Overview

System is a multiplayer, real-time, long-term 4X strategy game where the universe persists and evolves continuously, even when players are offline. Players manage multiple star systems, colonize planets, extract resources, construct buildings and spaceships, and expand their empires across the galaxy.

### Core Game Mechanics

- **Real-time Simulation**: Game runs continuously in the background, processing construction, resource extraction, and other actions even when players are offline
- **Multiple Game Instances**: Each galaxy is a separate game that can run independently for days or weeks
- **Procedural Generation**: Galaxies are procedurally generated with connected star systems via wormholes
- **Resource Management**: Extract and manage resources (Iron, Copper, Fuel, Soil) across planet grids
- **Building & Construction**: Build miners, farms, and other structures on planet surfaces
- **Fleet Management**: Construct and command spaceships for exploration and combat
- **Agent-Based AI**: Extensible agent system for autonomous entity behaviors

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS 4, React 19
- **Backend**: C# .NET 9, Entity Framework Core
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Cache/Pub-Sub**: Redis
- **Real-time Communication**: SignalR
- **Deployment**: Railway

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Performance at Scale**: Large galaxy generation and simulation
   - Mitigation: Phase 11 dedicated to optimization, load testing, monitoring

2. **Data Consistency**: Real-time updates vs. offline calculations
   - Mitigation: Existing simulation engine handles this, additional testing in Phase 12

3. **Combat Balance**: Making combat fun and balanced
   - Mitigation: Iterative design in Phase 8, playtesting in Phase 10

### Project Risks

1. **Scope Creep**: Adding features beyond MVP
   - Mitigation: Strict phase boundaries, phases 13-14 are post-launch only

2. **Testing Gaps**: Insufficient testing before launch
   - Mitigation: Dedicated phase 12 for comprehensive testing

3. **User Adoption**: Players not understanding the game
   - Mitigation: Phase 9 focused on onboarding and UX
