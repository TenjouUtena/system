## Technical Specifications

### Ship Stats by Type

| Ship Type  | Build Time | Speed | Cargo | Health | Attack | Defense | Special              |
|------------|------------|-------|-------|--------|--------|---------|----------------------|
| Scout      | 60s        | 20    | 10    | 50     | 5      | 5       | Fast exploration     |
| Colony     | 300s       | 5     | 50    | 100    | 0      | 10      | Colonizes planets    |
| Freighter  | 180s       | 8     | 1000  | 150    | 0      | 15      | Bulk resource transport |
| Destroyer  | 240s       | 12    | 50    | 200    | 50     | 30      | Combat vessel        |
| Cruiser    | 420s       | 10    | 100   | 300    | 80     | 50      | Heavy combat         |
| Carrier    | 600s       | 8     | 200   | 400    | 60     | 60      | Command ship         |
| Capital    | 900s       | 6     | 300   | 600    | 100    | 100     | Flagship             |

### Movement Mechanics
- **Within System**: Distance calculated using Euclidean distance, time = distance / speed
- **Between Systems**: Fixed 30 second wormhole travel time (300 distance units)
- **Validation**: Ensures wormhole connection exists for inter-system travel
- **State Management**: Ships in "Moving" state until arrival

### Colonization Mechanics
1. Colony ship must be in same system as target planet
2. Colony ship must be in Idle state
3. Creates space station for player if none exists
4. Creates builder on colonized planet
5. Destroys colony ship (one-time use)
6. Enables planetary development
