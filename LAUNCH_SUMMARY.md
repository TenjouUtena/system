- Cache headers (X-Cache: HIT/MISS)
- Smart cache invalidation
- Excludes authentication and real-time data

**Performance Benchmarks**:
- API response times: < 200ms p95
- Simulation can handle 100+ games
- Load tested up to 500 concurrent users
- Memory stable at ~500MB under load

### Phase 12: Documentation & Testing

**Documentation Created**:
- 12 phase completion documents
- Complete API documentation (Swagger)
- Player game guide with mechanics
- Deployment guides (local + Railway)
- Testing strategy
- Monitoring guidelines

**Testing Coverage**:
- Manual testing checklist completed
- Integration points verified
