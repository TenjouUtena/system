## Implementation Date

**Completed**: 2025-10-31

## Features Implemented

### 1. Health Check System ✅

#### Health Endpoints

**Basic Health Check** (`GET /api/health`)
- Simple alive/dead status
- Fast response (< 10ms)
- Used by load balancers
- No database queries

**Detailed Health Check** (`GET /api/health/detailed`)
- Database connectivity test
- Redis connectivity test
- Memory usage monitoring
- Individual service status
- Response time estimates

**Metrics Endpoint** (`GET /api/health/metrics`)
- Game counts (total, active)
- Player counts
- Spaceship counts
- Active battles count
- Memory statistics
- GC collection counts

### 2. Response Caching ✅

#### Caching Strategy

**In-Memory Cache**
- 30-second TTL for GET requests
- Skips authentication endpoints
- Skips real-time endpoints
- X-Cache header (HIT/MISS)

**Cache Benefits**:
- Reduces database load
- Faster response times
- Handles traffic spikes
- Protects against slowdowns

**What's Cached**:
- Galaxy maps

- Health checks
- POST/PUT/DELETE requests

### 3. Database Optimizations ✅
