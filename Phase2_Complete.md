# Phase 2 Complete: Galaxy & System Generation

## Summary

Phase 2 has been successfully completed! The game now supports creating multiple independent game instances with procedurally generated galaxies containing connected star systems.

## What's Been Implemented

### Backend Entities & Data Model âœ…
- **Game**: Represents a single game instance (multiple games can exist)
- **PlayerGame**: Links players to games (many-to-many relationship)
- **Galaxy**: Contains star systems for a game
- **StarSystem**: Individual solar systems with X/Y coordinates
- **Wormhole**: Connections between systems ensuring full connectivity
- **Planet**: Planets orbiting star systems with size-based grids

### Galaxy Generation Algorithm âœ…
- **Procedural Generation**: Creates N systems at random but spatially distributed positions
- **Minimum Spanning Tree**: Ensures all systems are connected via wormholes
- **Additional Connections**: Adds 1-4 random wormholes per system for gameplay variety
- **System Placement**: Uses distance-based collision detection to space systems
- **Planet Generation**: Each system gets 1-4 planets with random sizes (3-8) and types

### API Endpoints âœ…
- `GET /api/games` - List all active games with player counts
- `GET /api/games/{id}` - Get game details
- `POST /api/games` - Create new game with galaxy generation
- `POST /api/games/{id}/join` - Join an existing game
- `GET /api/games/{id}/galaxy` - Get galaxy map data
- `GET /api/games/{id}/systems/{systemId}` - Get system details with planets

### Frontend Features âœ…
- **Game Lobby**: Browse, create, and join games
- **Galaxy Map**: Interactive SVG visualization showing all systems and wormholes
- **System Details**: View planets in a specific system
- **Create Game Modal**: Form to configure new games (system count, player limits, etc.)
- **Navigation**: Smooth flow between games, maps, and system details

## Technical Highlights

### Data Model Relationships
```
Game (1) â”€â”€â”€â”€ (1) Galaxy â”€â”€â”€â”€ (N) StarSystem
  â”‚                                     â”‚
  â”‚ (N)                            (N) Planet
  â”‚
PlayerGame (N) â”€â”€â”€â”€ (N) Player

StarSystem â”€â”€â”€â”€ (N) Wormhole â”€â”€â”€â”€ (N) StarSystem
```

### Galaxy Generation Algorithm
1. **Place Systems**: Random positions with minimum distance constraints
2. **Build MST**: Create minimum spanning tree for guaranteed connectivity
3. **Add Connections**: Random additional wormholes (1-4 per system)
4. **Generate Planets**: For each system, create 1-4 planets with varying properties

The MST ensures that every system is reachable from any other system, which is critical for gameplay.

### Visualization
The galaxy map uses SVG with:
- **Coordinate Transformation**: Scales and offsets to fit viewport
- **Wormhole Lines**: Purple lines connecting systems
- **System Circles**: Yellow circles representing stars
- **Interactive**: Click systems to view details
- **Responsive**: Works on different screen sizes

## Testing the Features

### Create a Game
1. Navigate to `/games`
2. Click "Create Game"
3. Fill in game details
4. Galaxy generation happens automatically (takes a few seconds)
5. You're redirected to the galaxy map

### Explore the Galaxy
1. View all systems on the interactive map
2. Click any system to see its planets
3. View planet types, sizes, and grid dimensions

### Join Games
1. From the lobby, click "Join" or "View" on any game
2. Players can share the same game instance
3. View galaxy together (shared state)

## Database Migration

A new migration `Phase2GameEntities` has been created and is ready to apply:

```bash
cd system-be/SystemGame.Api
dotnet ef database update
```

This migration adds:
- Games, PlayerGames tables
- Galaxies, StarSystems, Wormholes, Planets tables
- Proper foreign keys and indexes
- Check constraints (e.g., wormhole can't connect a system to itself)

## Performance Considerations

- **Galaxy Generation**: For 20 systems, generation takes ~1-2 seconds
- **Map Loading**: Fetches all systems and wormholes in parallel
- **Distance Calculations**: Uses Euclidean distance for MST algorithm
- **Navigation Properties**: Eager loading with Include() for efficiency

## Known Limitations (Future Enhancements)

1. No resource generation yet (planned for Phase 3)
2. No building or construction features
3. No player spawning or starting locations
4. No fog of war or visibility mechanics
5. No planet surface grid visualization
6. Simple 2D visualization (could be enhanced with 3D)

## Next Phase: Phase 3

Phase 3 will implement:
- **Planet Grids**: Generate resource grids for each planet
- **Resource Distribution**: Iron, Copper, Fuel, Soil with realistic clustering
- **Planet Surface View**: Visualize the resource grid
- **Grid Square Details**: Show resource quantities per tile

## Files Created/Modified

### Backend
- `Data/Entities/Game.cs`, `PlayerGame.cs`, `Galaxy.cs`
- `Data/Entities/StarSystem.cs` (renamed from System.cs to avoid namespace conflict)
- `Data/Entities/Wormhole.cs`, `Planet.cs`
- `Contexts/ApplicationDbContext.cs` (updated)
- `Services/GalaxyGeneratorService.cs`
- `Controllers/GamesController.cs`
- `Models/*.cs` (various DTOs)

### Frontend
- `lib/types/game.ts`
- `lib/api/game.ts`
- `app/games/page.tsx` (lobby)
- `app/games/[id]/page.tsx` (galaxy map)
- `app/games/[id]/systems/[systemId]/page.tsx` (system details)

## Code Quality

- âœ… All code compiles without errors
- âœ… No linter warnings
- âœ… Type-safe (C# and TypeScript)
- âœ… Proper error handling
- âœ… Clean separation of concerns
- âœ… Comprehensive entity relationships

Phase 2 is complete and ready for testing! ðŸŽ‰
